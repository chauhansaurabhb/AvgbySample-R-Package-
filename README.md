# AvgbySample-R-Package-
This package is just an extension of mean function in R. Sometimes we are interested in calculating the avg or mean value by sample size. For example, compute the mean of 5 temperature samples. The function accepts a data column as input along with sample size and produces the data frame of avg values as output. For instance, we have 10 samples of temperature [25,28,29,26,20,35,42,41,33,28] and we are interested in computing the mean by 5 samples than dataframe of mean could be [25.6, 35.8]. More real word scenario is when a user is interested in capturing a data in particular window and enables this functionality over that window.
