Sometimes we are interested in calculating the avg or mean value by sample size. For example, compute the mean of 5 temperature samples. The function accepts a data column as input along with sample size and produces the data frame of avg values as output. For instance, we have 10 samples of temperature [25,28,29,26,20,35,42,41,33,28] and we are interested in computing the mean by 5 samples than dataframe of mean could be [25.6, 35.8]. More real word scenario is when a user is interested in capturing a data in particular window and enables this functionality over that window.\nLicense: MIT + file LICENSE\nEncoding: UTF-8\nLazyData: true\nRoxygenNote: 6.0.1\n",
